Title: Interactive dygraphs from Tidy Time-series Data
Version: 0.5.0
Authors@R: person("Joe", "Shannon", email = "jpshanno@mtu.edu", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Long time series datasets can be difficult to plot and examine using
    static figures. Interactive plots using the dygraphs package are a great tool
    but are currently not easily implemented for tidy data. This package provides
    methods for dygraph() to make it easier to plot tidy time series.
